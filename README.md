Document your python code.

# Setup the workflow: -
1. Clone the repository with this command:
```
git clone git@github.com:heylightning/codoc-ext.git
```
2. Load the extension in your web browser using the following steps:
    * Open your web browser (Chrome, Firefox, etc.).
    * Go to the browser's extension management page. For example, in Chrome, you can navigate to ` chrome://extensions `.
    * Enable the "Developer mode" or a similar option in your browser.
    * Look for an option to "Load unpacked" or "Load extension" and choose that option.
    * Select the folder where you have your extension project (the one containing ` manifest.json `).
3. Your extension should now be loaded and visible in your browser's toolbar. Click on the extension icon to open the extension.

*Note: Requirements and setup are staged for VERSION 1.0.0*

## Description

### Python Code Documentation Extension üßë‚Äçüíª
This Python code documentation extension is designed to analyze a Python code input and generate a documentation object. 

Here is the ` documentationObject ` : - 
```javascript

    const documentationObject = {
        userDefinedFunctions: userDefinedFunctions,
        globalVariables: globalVariables,
        printStatements: printStatements,
        userDefinedClasses: userDefinedClasses,
        importedLibraries: importedLibraries,
        numberOfConditionalStatements: numberOfConditionalStatements,
        numberOfSwitchStatements: numberOfSwitchStatements,
        numberOfLoops: numberOfLoops,
        numberOfReturnStatements: numberOfReturnStatements
    };

```

The documentation object contains the following attributes and also gives the option to download the output as PDF file too:

1. ` userDefinedFunctions ` : This attribute represents an array of user-defined functions present in the code. It includes the names, parameters and details of all functions defined by the user in the input Python code.

2. ` globalVariables ` : This attribute represents an array of global variables used in the code.

3. ` printStatements ` : This attribute contains an array of print statements found in the code. 

4. ` userDefinedClasses ` : This attribute represents an array of user-defined classes in the code.

5. ` importedLibraries ` : This attribute contains an array of imported libraries/modules in the code.

6. ` numberOfConditionalStatements ` : This attribute represents the count of conditional statements in the code. It indicates the number of if/elif/else statements used.

7. ` numberOfSwitchStatements ` : This attribute represents the count of switch statements in the code.

8. ` numberOfLoops ` : This attribute represents the count of loops in the code. It indicates the number of for loops, while loops, or other loop constructs used.

9. ` numberOfReturnStatements ` : This attribute represents the count of return statements in the code. It indicates the number of return statements used within functions or methods.

The Python code documentation extension utilizes these attributes to provide a comprehensive overview of the input code. It helps developers understand the structure, functions, variables, and control flow within the Python code, making it easier to maintain and collaborate on projects.
